# Car-Price-Prediction
## Objective
The objective of this project is to model the price of cars using the available independent variables. This model will help the management understand how car prices vary with different features, allowing them to manipulate car designs and business strategies to meet specific price levels. Additionally, the model will provide insights into the pricing dynamics of a new market.
## Key Components
### 1. Loading and Preprocessing
Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps.
Convert categorical variables to dummy variables.
Handle missing values and outliers if any.
### 2. Model Implementation
Implement the following five regression algorithms:

1 Linear Regression

2 Decision Tree Regressor

3 Random Forest Regressor

4 Gradient Boosting Regressor

5 Support Vector Regressor
### 3. Model Evaluation
Compare the performance of all the models based on R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Identify the best performing model and justify why it is the best.
### 4. Feature Importance Analysis
Identify the significant variables affecting car prices using feature selection techniques.
### 5.Hyperparameter Tuning
Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best performing model to check whether the performance has increased.
## Conclusion
This project involves loading and preprocessing the car price dataset, implementing multiple regression models, evaluating their performance, analyzing feature importance, and performing hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance. The best performing model will provide valuable insights into the factors affecting car prices, helping the management make informed decisions.
